Panah Task Manager

By Mohammad Omar Panah

This is my personal Task Manager web project, designed to help me keep track of daily tasks in a simple and interactive way. I built it as part of my journey learning web development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features

- Add tasks with a title and deadline
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Delete tasks 
- Filter tasks by All / Completed / Pending / Overdue  
- Overdue tasks are highlighted automatically  
- Clean, minimalist design that is easy to use 


  Technologies Used

- HTML5 – for the structure of the page  
- CSS3 – for styling with a unique, personal touch  
- JavaScript – for functionality, task management, and Local Storage  



 Design Highlights

- Personal header with my name and profile picture  
- Rounded cards and buttons with subtle shadows  
- Smooth hover effects for buttons and tasks  
- Minimalist, modern layout  
- Small footer with contact/GitHub link
